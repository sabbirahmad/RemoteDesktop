This is a desktop application to remotely access and share screen from another computer connected in the same local network.

Features:
  1. Share screen to another computer
  2. Control remotely by using mouse

  2. There are two users: Server and Client. Server is considered as the remote machine, and Client is considered as the machine to access Server remotely.
  3. The Server would show its IP as shown in screenshots
  4. User need to give a Port number for connection
  5. From the Client side, user need to input the Server IP and Port to connect to the Server.
